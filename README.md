This is our way of giving back to the community that we use so much from. 
At Broken Pixel Limited we almost always look for an open source solution to our
technical challenges when working with clients and to use during our day to day
business. This ranges from Open Source web servers to operating systems and 
development tools and coding languages.

In this repo you will find some of the core functionality we use in web page and
application development. We do this because we want to give back to the community
and make a better development world with the code we build and use. Our code is 
open to review by anyone so that we can make improvements and really become 
better developers as a result of such collaboration.

If you look through our codebase and use and part of it please credit us with 
its development with a publicly accessible acknowledgement.

If on the other hand you would like to us to work with you in building bespoke 
components or code bases please get in touch on our website.
